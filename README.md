# Hyperspectral-satellite-image-classification-Using-Deep-CNNs
This is a machine learning project that uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify hyperspectral satellite images. The code is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning.

## Installation
To use this project, you will need to clone this repository and install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to download the hyperspectral satellite image dataset used in this project, which can be found in the data folder.

## Usage
Once you have the project set up and the dataset downloaded, you can run the main script main.py to train and test the CNN models. The script includes various hyperparameters that can be adjusted to optimize model performance.

After training, the script will output a classification report that includes metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each class. The script will also save the trained model weights and architecture for future use.

## Contributing
This project is open to contributions and suggestions. If you have ideas for how to improve the code or add new features, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
